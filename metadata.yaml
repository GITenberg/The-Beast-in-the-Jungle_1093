description: In this psychological drama, Henry James explores the mind of John Marcher,
  a neurotic egoist obsessed with the lurking feeling that something amazing is going
  to happen to him. James borrowed this concept from the notebooks of his good friend,
  author Constance Fenimore Woolson, who had fallen to her death from her window in
  Venice a few years earlier. Many see The Beast in the Jungle as James' attempt to
  work through his feelings over his relationship with Constance, but the book is
  engaging regardless of autobiographical interpretation.
